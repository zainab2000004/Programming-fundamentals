Tic Tac Toe Game in C
📌 Overview

This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in the C programming language. It allows two players to play alternately on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

The game demonstrates basic C programming concepts such as arrays, functions, condition checking, and loops.

🎮 Features

Two-player mode (Player X and Player O).

3x3 board displayed after every move.

Checks for win conditions (row, column, diagonal).

Declares a winner or a draw when the game ends.

Input validation for valid moves.

🛠️ How It Works

The game board is represented using a 3x3 character array.

Players take turns entering the position (1–9) where they want to place their mark.

The program updates the board and checks:

If a player has won.

If the board is full (draw).

The game ends with a result message (Winner or Draw).
